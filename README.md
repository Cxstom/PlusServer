<h1>Introduction</h1><br/>
<p>Project Plus is an open source community development, actively worked on and primarily sourced from DevBest. The aim of this project is to work on the original PlusEmu release and improve it, together as a community.

<h1>Downloads</h1><br/>
<p>Do you prefer to download a zip package of the emulator source? We have a download area available <a href="http://downloads.projectplus.io/">here</a>. The downloads area is manually updated, and not automatic - whereas the Git is always up to date. We make uploads generally a day after we have confirmed a new release.</p>
